# API Reference & manual {#mainpage}
OGRE is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce games and demos utilising 3D hardware. The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.

## Versions
OGRE is not one, but two “sister” projects. They are related, but they are not the same – as in being not compatible to one another. You may be confused which version to pick. See [a comparison on how they differ](https://www.ogre3d.org/about/what-version-to-choose).

* Ogre 1.x: original project, still active with focus on...
* Ogre 2.x (a.k.a "Ogre Next")
  * Ogre 2.0: Intermediate version to port 1.x projects to 2.x, includes new material system (HLMS)
  * Ogre 2.1: More stuff
  * Ogre 2.2: Latest, more stuff
